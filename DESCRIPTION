Title: Identification of cancer cell lines based on their weighted mutational/ variational fingerprint
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Raik", "Otto", email = "raik.otto@hu-berlin.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This packages enables users to identify cancer cell lines. The identification is
    based on the locations or loci of somatic and germline differences with respect to a reference geome.
    The input format is VCF and the files have to contain a single cancer cell line sample. 
    The implemented method is optimized for the Next-generation whole exome and whole genome DNA-sequencing 
    technology.
